      title: "The business runs on spreadsheets",
      what: "Core operations live in Excel or Google Sheets instead of a real system.",

    "sap-overkill": {
      title: "SAP is heavier than you need",
      what: "You run SAP at a company size where its cost and complexity rarely pay off.",
      why: "High licensing and consultant costs, slow changes, and a steep learning curve. A leaner ERP like Odoo covers the same ground at a fraction of the total cost.",
    },
    "quickbooks-outgrown": {
      title: "You've outgrown QuickBooks",
      what: "QuickBooks handles accounting, but your operations, inventory, and sales live outside it.",

      what: "Your core tools (bank, e-commerce, CRM, e-invoicing) aren't connected to each other.",

      title: "Too much manual work",

    disconnected: {
      title: "Systems don't talk to each other",

      title: "Tax and compliance friction",

    support: {
      title: "Weak support / key-person risk",
      what: "Support is slow, or everything depends on one person who knows the system.",

    cost: {
      title: "Licensing and upkeep cost too much",
      what: "Licenses, maintenance, or consultant fees feel too high for what you get.",
